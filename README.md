This repository contains all the code used for running the experiments conducted on our work **On the Robustness of Adversarially Trained Models against Uncertainty Attack**, submitted at Pattern Recognition, August 2024.

## Quick Tests :test_tube:
From the colab it is possible to see the over- and under-confidence attacks in action with a quick snippet of code, visualizing the uncertainty span of any sample on any RobustBench model.

## Reproducing the Experiments :microscope:
The file `main_attack.py` can be used for running a single experiment on a RobustBench model.
